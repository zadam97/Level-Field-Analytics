# Level-Field-Analytics
React-Native Project for Level Field Analytics


Amateur football players need trackable, reliable, and consumable data.  The current common practices in high school football data collection require manual reporting and limited analytics of raw data. Market research shows that statistical data is important to high school football players â€“ especially those looking towards college recruitment. College football recruiters are relying on inconsistent data and player reputation for narrowing their search field. With pricy combines and technology and subjective reputations limiting the visibility of players in particular sociogenic/social groups, the concern that players with massive potential are being overlooked in the recruitment process emanates amateur football.
Level Field believes the market is open for a wearable device to enter and provide objective and unbiased relevant statistics to overcome the subjective nature of sports recruiting.


In order to provide this we are working on mobile applications that will be able to present the data High School Football players want in a simple and straightforward mannor.
